If you don't know what a virtual machine is check out this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIVXjl4SwVo\n\nChoosing which operating system you want to work with is up to you. But I would recommend Ubuntu for people who are just learning linux, and Kali for those who are more advanced.\n\nGetting started with Ubuntu: https://itsfoss.com/install-linux-in-virtualbox/\n\nGetting started with Kali: https://www.nakivo.com/blog/how-to-install-kali-linux-on-virtualbox/\n\nOnce you have one of these installed it will make solving complex problems in future CTFs easier.")

Let them know about the dangers of clicking on random links sent to them\nas email is one of the easiest ways to break into someones machine and steal EVERYTHING. \n\n- Try using Wireshark\nWireshark is a packet sniffer and analysis tool that captures network traffic on a local network and stores the data for offline analysis. \nthis website is a great tutorial to get you into this fantastic tool: https://www.varonis.com/blog/how-to-use-wireshark/\nWireshark comes on Kali Linux so get a kali vm up and running and you're good to go. \n\n- Create a small script \nWrite a basic script using a scripting language such as Bash, PowerShell, Python, etc, to create a local user account on a computer and set permissions as you see fit. \nBut make sure this is done in a script that can be executable through a shell on whatever box you want. \n(Scripting is easier than you think and is an excellent tool)\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-scripting-languages/\n\nIf you complete these and like the stuff you did, I highly recommend checking out this website to tackle some harder challenges and really build a foundational knowledge in the field. https://cybercademy.org/\nEnjoy!!")
